The description of this environment is as follows (taken from: https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/main/gymnasium/envs/classic_control/cartpole.py)"

    "> ## Description\n",
    "> \n",
    "> This environment corresponds to the version of the cart-pole problem described by Barto, Sutton, and Anderson in [\"Neuronlike Adaptive Elements That Can Solve Difficult Learning Control Problem\"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6313077). A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">## Action Space\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The action is a `ndarray` with shape `(1,)` which can take values `{0, 1}` indicating the direction of the fixed force the cart is pushed with.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- 0: Push cart to the left\n",
    ">- 1: Push cart to the right\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Note**: The velocity that is reduced or increased by the applied force is not fixed and it depends on the angle the pole is pointing. The center of gravity of the pole varies the amount of energy needed to move the cart underneath it\n",
    ">\n",
    ">## Observation Space\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(4,)` with the values corresponding to the following positions and velocities:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">| Num | Observation           | Min                 | Max               |\n",
    ">|-----|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n",
    ">| 0   | Cart Position         | -4.8                | 4.8               |\n",
    ">| 1   | Cart Velocity         | -Inf                | Inf               |\n",
    ">| 2   | Pole Angle            | ~ -0.418 rad (-24°) | ~ 0.418 rad (24°) |\n",
    ">| 3   | Pole Angular Velocity | -Inf                | Inf               |\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Note:** While the ranges above denote the possible values for observation space of each element, it is not reflective of the allowed values of the state space in an unterminated episode. Particularly:\n",
    ">-  The cart x-position (index 0) can be take values between `(-4.8, 4.8)`, but the episode terminates if the cart leaves the `(-2.4, 2.4)` range.\n",
    ">-  The pole angle can be observed between  `(-.418, .418)` radians (or **±24°**), but the episode terminates if the pole angle is not in the range `(-.2095, .2095)` (or **±12°**)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">## Rewards\n",
    ">Since the goal is to keep the pole upright for as long as possible, by default, a reward of `+1` is given for every step taken, including the termination step. The default reward threshold is 500 for v1 and 200 for v0 due to the time limit on the environment.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">If `sutton_barto_reward=True`, then a reward of `0` is awarded for every non-terminating step and `-1` for the terminating step. As a result, the reward threshold is 0 for v0 and v1.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">## Starting State\n",
    ">All observations are assigned a uniformly random value in `(-0.05, 0.05)`\n",
    ">\n",
    ">## Episode End\n",
    ">The episode ends if any one of the following occurs:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">1. Termination: Pole Angle is greater than ±12°\n",
    ">2. Termination: Cart Position is greater than ±2.4 (center of the cart reaches the edge of the display)\n",
    ">3. Truncation: Episode length is greater than 500 (200 for v0)"

To still be able to use Q-learning, we need to **discretize** our system. This is done by quantisation of all observations in separate buckets (or bins) and refering to them by the index of the bucket in which they belong.\n",
    "E.g. if we know that cart velocity is always within the range -0.5..0.5 and we want to use four bins for discretization, we could transform the real-valued cart velocity $v$ to a discrete value $v_d=0$ if $v < -0.25$, to $v_d=1$ if $-0.25 \\leq v < 0$, to $v_d=2$ if $0 \\leq v < 0.25$, and to $v_d=3$ if $v \\geq 0.5$.

    "# Exercise 3: Deep Q-learning (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an optional exercise, you can study a deep Q-network as an alternative solution to the cart pole problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Q-network does not require a discretization of the state space, but as you will see, it can take quite a while to learn. You can try to run the following code in Colab and even use a GPU for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below has been adapted from [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Advanced-Deep-Learning-with-Keras/blob/master/chapter9-drl/dqn-cartpole-9.6.1.py). It uses two \"tricks\" that are helpful when training a deep Q-network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Replay memory**: As decribed in the lecture slides, learning from batches of consecutive simulation samples is problematic: Consecutive samples in time are presumably highly correlated. This correlation in training batches leads to inefficient training and may bias the result. To deal with this problem, it is advisable to establish a replay memory and then sample (non-consecutive) state-action data points from this memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Target networks**: In Q-Learning, we update \"a guess with a guess\" which can lead to unstable results. The Bellman equation defines a relationship between Q(s(t), a(t)) and Q(s(t+1), a(t+1)). Altering Q(s(t), a(t)) may influence Q(s(t+1), a(t+1)) and other states nearby, leading to fluctuations in the training results. To overcome this effect, a copy of the network is used to compute Q(s(t+1), a(t+1)). This copy is not trained, but only periodically synced to the main network.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on both measures can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-q-network-dqn-ii-b6bf911b6b2c).\n",
    "\n",
    "Study the code below and add a three layer fully connected network (each layer with 256 nodes and ReLU activation). \n",
    "Find the replay memory and target network implementations. Run the network (this may take a while, you may start with smaller networks at first), and check the results of the network.\n"
