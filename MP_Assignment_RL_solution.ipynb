This is done by quantisation of all observations in separate buckets (or bins) and refering to them by the index of the bucket in which they belong.\n",

    "# Exercise 3: Deep Q-learning (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an optional exercise, you can study a deep Q-network as an alternative solution to the cart pole problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Q-network does not require a discretization of the state space, but as you will see, it can take quite a while to learn. You can try to run the following code in Colab and even use a GPU for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below has been adapted from [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Advanced-Deep-Learning-with-Keras/blob/master/chapter9-drl/dqn-cartpole-9.6.1.py). It uses two \"tricks\" that are helpful when training a deep Q-network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Replay memory**: As decribed in the lecture slides, learning from batches of consecutive simulation samples is problematic: Consecutive samples in time are presumably highly correlated. This correlation in training batches leads to inefficient training and may bias the result. To deal with this problem, it is advisable to establish a replay memory and then sample (non-consecutive) state-action data points from this memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Target networks**: In Q-Learning, we update \"a guess with a guess\" which can lead to unstable results. The Bellman equation defines a relationship between Q(s(t), a(t)) and Q(s(t+1), a(t+1)). Altering Q(s(t), a(t)) may influence Q(s(t+1), a(t+1)) and other states nearby, leading to fluctuations in the training results. To overcome this effect, a copy of the network is used to compute Q(s(t+1), a(t+1)). This copy is not trained, but only periodically synced to the main network.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on both measures can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-q-network-dqn-ii-b6bf911b6b2c).\n",
    "\n",
    "Study the code below and find the replay memory and target network implementations. Run the network (this may take a while, you may start with smaller networks at first), and check the results of the network.\n"
